User Registration Scenarios:
- Valid user registration with all required fields filled correctly.
- Attempt to register with missing fields (e.g., without entering an email or password).
- Try registration with an already-registered email to test for duplicate email handling.
- Register using invalid data formats (e.g., incorrect email format, weak password).
- Verify success or error messages for each scenario.

User Login Scenarios:
- Successful login with valid credentials.
- Unsuccessful login attempts with incorrect credentials (e.g., wrong email, wrong password).
- Login with a non-registered email.
- Test for account lockouts or rate limiting after multiple failed login attempts (if applicable).
- Verify logout functionality to ensure the user is logged out properly.

 Design Test Cases for Each Scenario
- Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.
- Test Title: Short, descriptive name (e.g., “Register with Valid Details”).
- Preconditions: Any setup required (e.g., ensure the test email isn’t already registered).
- Test Steps:
- Open the registration or login page.
- Enter test data into form fields (e.g., email, password).
- Submit the form.
- Expected Result: Describe the expected outcome (e.g., user sees a “Registration Successful” message, or “Invalid Login” error).
- Postconditions: Any required cleanup (e.g., deleting the test user from the database if needed).
